It made me realise, how much time and effort I have wasted moving my hand back and forth between keyboard and mouse. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, mouse is a really useful device and I don‚Äôt plan on getting rid of it. But when it comes to coding it‚Äôs just more natural to use a keyboard.</p>\n<p>It took me some time to understand that Vim is actually making me efficient. Once you pass the whole ‚ÄúWhat keys I should press to get to that line?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy are there 3 modes!!‚Äù, ‚ÄúI hate Vim so much!‚Äù and ‚ÄúArrrgghhhhhh!!‚Äù, believe me, after writing the first part, there was a time when I was frustrated with Vim so much that I did not use it for a whole week (<em>We were on a break, and I might have used VSCode</em>).</p>\n<p>It made me realize the mistake I was making, I was trying to learn all of Vim at once. Like all of it! I wanted to be a master at Vim. It made me recall of a time from the Gym.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you want to bench 80 Kgs on your first day of the Gym, you are going to fail. Miserably.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just like benching 80 Kgs, you don‚Äôt learn all of the Vim on the first day. You cannot. You start with 10 Kgs, and gradually improve yourself to 80 Kilograms. (For those who are wondering, I still can‚Äôt lift more than 50 Kgs üòÖ).</p>\n<p>Anyways, the point here is that if you want to learn Vim, start with the basic key movements. I know its really tempting to learn all the tricks and install all sorts of plugins to do the thing you want to do in 2 key-strokes, but that‚Äôs not going to help in the long run. At least it did not help me. I realized that if I try to learn all 100+ combinations at once, I am not learning anything at all. You need to learn the basic movements first (start with 10 or so) and then gradually add more keys to your Vim arsenal. First, try to get it done using brute force.</p>\n<h2 id=\"something-which-helped-me\"><a href=\"#something-which-helped-me\" aria-label=\"something which helped me permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Something which helped me</h2>\n<p>In your early days, if you are going to directly use Vim in your projects where you need to do a lot of thinking (like you are figuring out an algorithm or debugging a nasty bug from last 3 days), I would recommend not use Vim use at all (at least during the first few weeks). It will only make you more frustrated. Initially, I only used Vim for writing documentations, and blog posts like these. There‚Äôs not a lot of mode switching and you are more or less in your comfort zone.</p>\n<p>Also, I changed my Vim color theme to match my VSCode theme (which tricked my  little brain to think I was still in VSCode).</p>\n<p>If you want you can also install one of those VIM-mode plugins in your favourite editor and get started there. It personally felt a little weird to me, but I would recommend you to try.</p>\n<h2 id=\"start-with-these-keys\"><a href=\"#start-with-these-keys\" aria-label=\"start with these keys permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Start with these keys</h2>\n<p>To start with, I would recommend with these ~10 keys to help you understand the movement and basic editing. Spend a week or 2 focussing on just these keys until you feel comfortable with them.</p>\n<p>Also remember, this is going to be the hardest part of your Vim journey.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">j</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">k</code> to move up and down</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">h</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">l</code> to move left and right</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">w</code> to move forward by a word</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">b</code> to move backward by a word</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What should be your aim here? When can you say that you are good at using these keys?</p>\n<p>The point when you can say that you have mastered these keys would be when you don‚Äôt have to think about what keys to press when you want to ‚Äúmove 5 words forward‚Äù or ‚Äúgo 4 lines down‚Äù. It should naturally come to you without thinking. We can then say that you are ready for the next keys!</p>\n<p>These are a couple of keys to help you with the basic editing. You can learn them in parallel with the keys above.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">yy</code> Yank (Copy) a line</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">p</code> paste the line you just yanked, a line below your current line (It will paste whatever is in your <em>register</em> (think of it as your clipboard))</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">dd</code> delete the line that you just pasted (it will also move it to the <em>register</em>)</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">u</code> will undo your last command</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are some very basic commands (and easy to learn) but very powerful. Take some time to master these.</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs move to our final set of keys!</p>\n<p>Many a times you might need to delete a block of text all at once. You can do <code class=\"language-text\">dd dd dd dd</code> to delete multiple lines (4 in this case), but you can also do this</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Press <code class=\"language-text\">Shift + v</code> this will put you in ‚ÄúVisual Line mode‚Äù and now you can use the  <code class=\"language-text\">j</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">k</code> keys to start highlighting lines and then press <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> to delete all the highlighted part at once!</li>\n<li>There‚Äôs one more ‚ÄúVisual mode‚Äù. If you just press <code class=\"language-text\">v</code> it will put you in visual mode but only highlight your current character. From there you can perform your usual movements using <code class=\"language-text\">w</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">b</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">h</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">j</code> , <code class=\"language-text\">k</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">l</code>  keys to highlight the parts you want to delete with <code class=\"language-text\">d</code>.  (Or you can use <code class=\"language-text\">y</code> to yank that part and paste somewhere else using <code class=\"language-text\">p</code>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Mastering  <code class=\"language-text\">h</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">j</code> , <code class=\"language-text\">k</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">l</code>  is coming handy now üòâ</p>\n<h2 id=\"writing-text\"><a href=\"#writing-text\" aria-label=\"writing text permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Writing text</h2>\n<p>Now probably at sometime in your coding, you would want to write your own stuff and not just copy paste from other files (I hate when this happens).</p>\n<p>For those times we have the ‚ÄúInsert mode‚Äù.
